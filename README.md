This repository contains the coding chanllenges for candidates to solve. Including C# and JavaScript.

# NOTICE

<img src="images/pullrequest.jpg" width="400" >

1. Please fork this repository and **create a pull request** when you are done. We will review your code and get back to you. All these git operations are part of the chanllenges.

2. Candidates must take at least 2 C# chanllenges and 2 JavaScript chanllenges. Think creatively and expand upon their code for the programming challenges would be considered a plus.

3. For any enquiry about chanllenges, please create issues in this repository.

4. Details of implementation will be discussed during the interview. So try to solve the chanllenges by yourself first. We value honesty and integrity.



# C# Chanllenges

1. Design a C# class to represent products in an online store, including attributes such as product name, price, and inventory. Implement shopping cart functionality that allows users to add, delete, and checkout products.

2. Write a C# program to create a simple file system with features for file creation, reading, writing, and deletion.

3. Create a C# class to model a library's borrowing system, including functionalities for borrowing and returning books. Implement calculations for borrowing periods and overdue fines.

4. Write a C# program that takes a string parameter and checks if it is a valid xml message and how many xml messages it contains. Message example:

```xml
<RandomTag123 RandomAttribute1="2.0" RandomAttribute2="2022-10-07T09:12:41Z">
  <RandomTag456 RandomAttribute3="27012023-005" RandomAttribute4="100" RandomAttribute5="999">
    <RandomTag789 RandomAttribute6="Normal" RandomAttribute7="1" />
    <RandomTag101112 RandomAttribute8="" RandomAttribute9="1101-01-001-A0001A01-R" RandomAttribute10="0" RandomAttribute11="1" RandomAttribute12="2022-11-11" />
  </RandomTag456>
</RandomTag123>
```

5. Design a C# class to represent student information, including attributes like name, student ID, and grades. Implement functions to calculate statistics and sort student grades.

6. Use C# to build a basic TCP server and client program. The server should accept client connections and process incoming messages.

7. Write a C# program using Socket programming to create a simple port scanner to detect open ports on a specified host.

8. Design a C# class for network file transfer, including functionalities for upload, download, and support for resuming interrupted transfers.


# JavaScript Chanllenges

1. Implement a JavaScript function that takes an array parameter and calculates the maximum sum of continuous subarrays in the array.

2. Write a JavaScript program to create a simple chatroom application that allows users to send and receive messages.

3. Create a simple chart library using JavaScript, allowing users to input data and generate bar charts or line charts.

4. Write a JavaScript function that takes a string parameter and counts the occurrence of each word in the string. Output a sorted list of words based on their frequency.

5. Implement a JavaScript function that takes a date parameter and calculates the number of working days and non-working days in the month of that date.

6. Use JavaScript to create a basic WebSocket client for bidirectional communication with a server.

7. Implement a JavaScript function that takes a URL parameter and checks if the URL is available (can be accessed successfully).
